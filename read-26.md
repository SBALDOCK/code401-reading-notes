2. What's the different between a framework and a library?

- A library provides "furniture" for your home that already exists, whereas a framework is like building a home from the blueprints and a few limited choices. The technical difference involves **inversion control**.
- With a libary, the user is in control of the flow of the application. The user chooses when and where to use the library.
- With a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow, providing places for the users to plug in code. It tells the developer what it needs whereas a library does not.

### Vocabulary

- **Rendering** - Displaying a react element to the page or DOM by using `ReactDOM.render()`
  - [resource](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html)
- **Templates** - Templates are pre-structured foundations for building applications rather than starting from a comppletely blank slate.
  They provide some built-in elements upon which a developer can create.
- **State** - A state object is where property values are stored that belong to a react componenet. when a state object changes, the component re-renders
