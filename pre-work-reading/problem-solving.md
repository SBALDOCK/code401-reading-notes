# How to Solve Programming Problems

#### Most programmers make key mistakes when given a programming problem during an interview

* Avoid trying to write code as soon as possible
  * Make sure you take the time to fully understand the problem before attempting to solve it
  * Avoid trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration. Keep it simple and don't try to get fancy

* Simple steps to solve any algorithm type programming problem
  * Read the problem completely twice
    * Test whether you can explain the problem to someone else
    * If given examples, work through them and understand why the answers are correct for each one
    * If you don't understand the problem, you cannot solve it
  * Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data
    * Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually
    * It is important to solve manually first so you know what you will automate
    * Seek corner cases and edge cases
    * Recognize what your brain is doing to solve a problem manually
  * Optimize the manual steps
    * Worth the effort to optimize or simplify manual solution
    * Figure out another way to solve the problem easier or with less code
  * Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code
    * Can be skipped if you have a good handle on the problem
    * Capture all the steps you created and write them as pseudo-code that can be translated to real code
  * Replace comments or pseudo-code with real code
    * Take each comment or pseudo-code and simply write code
  * Optimize real code
    * Look for ways to simplify your code
    * Optimize variable names meaningfully
    
* As much as 70% of time should be spent on steps 1-3
