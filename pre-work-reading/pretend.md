# Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour and You'll Become 100x More Productive

### How you value your time is how you value your life

* Most people value their time at far less than it's worth
* What if you placed a high value on your time?
  * How would you change your life, family, future?
* Busyness isn't a badge of honor, it is a sign of weakness

* Your time is not unlike your paycheck. If you don't budget for things you will have nothing left over by the end of the month
* **The state of all who are preoccupied is wretched, bu the most wretched are those who are toiling not even at their own preoccupations...If such people want to know how short their lives are, let them reflect how small a portion is their own**

* Busyness and stress are the enemy

* Extremely successful people don't tolerate busywork or distraction. They have crystal clear vision on their goals, and do what they need to do to get there, every single day

* As you think so you are
  * Teach people that your time is expensive, important, and valuable. People will respond in kind
  * What you think is what you become. 

* You can do amazing things, but only if you have time to do them
