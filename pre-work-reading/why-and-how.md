# 5 Whys - Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly

* Recurrent problems are often a sign of deeper issues
* Quick fixes seem convenient, but do not get to the root problem
* 5 Whys technique developed by Japanese industrialist **Sakichi Toyoda** in the 1930s.

* Simple method - When a problem occurs, drill down to its root by asking **Why** five times. Then, when the counter-measure becomes apparent, follow it through to prevent the issue from recurring
  * The method uses "counter-measures" rather than "solutions" as counter-measures are an action or set of actions to prevent the problem from arising again. They tend to be more robust tha  a "solution".

* Use 5 Whys Method for troubleshooting, quality improvement and problem solving. Most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems

* Might not be useful to solve complex or critical problems as it can result in the pursuit of a single track or limited possible counter-measures when there could actually be multiple causes to an issue.

### How to use the 5 Whys Method

* Assemble a team
* Define the problem
  * Observe the problem in action if you can
* Ask the first "Why"
  * For instance, ask your team why the problem is occurring
* Ask "Why" four more times
  * For each answer in the previous step, ask four more "whys in succession. 
  * Frame the question in response to the answer just recorded
* Know When To Stop
  * You will know when you've revealed the root cause of a problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses.
* Address the Root Cause(s)
  * Discuss and agress on the counter-measures
* Monitor counter-measures
  * Keep a close watch to see how effective counter-measures are
