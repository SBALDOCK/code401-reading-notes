# How to think like a programmer -- lessons in problem solving

### Thinking like a programmer is all about a more effective way to problem solve

#### Unless you have a system for problem-solving, you likely try randomly with something like this.

* Try a solution
* If that doesn't work, try another one
* If that doesn't work, repeat step 2 until you luck out

* **The best way to solve problems is to establish a framework and practice it**

* Establish a framework
  * **Understand** - Know exactly what is being asked. 
    * Most hard problems are hard due to a lack of understanding
    * You will know when you understand a problem when you can explain it in plain English
    * Write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it 
  * **Plan** - Don't dive right into solving without a plan
    * Write down exact steps
    * Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process information
    * Use comments to devise the plan
  * **Divide** - Do not try to solve one big problem
    * Break problem into sub-problems that are much easier to solve
    * Begin with the simplest, either those you know the answer to or those that don't depend on others being solved
    * Connect the dots between solved sub-problems
  * **Stuck?** - The best programmers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated
    * Debug - Go step by step through your solution 
    * Reassess - Take a step back and look at the problem from another perspective
    * Don't get lost in the details of a problem and overlook the general principles that would solve it at a more general level
    * Research - Google is your friend
  * **Practice** - Don't expect to be great after just one week. 
    * Try to solve at least one challenge every day
