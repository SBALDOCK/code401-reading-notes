## Ethics

The Code I'm Still Ashamed Of

* This article hits home for me for reasons I will not discuss in this summary. As the reliance upon technology continues to deepen, companies that are trying to sell a product have a responsibility to do so in an ethical manner. In this instance, it means disclosing every piece of information available in order to allow the consumer to make an informed decision about the product. This phenomenon is a sick byproduct of unfettered capitalism, where profit takes precedence over human life. This is not unique, but the implications for the potential spread of misinformation through technology are great. As a developer, I will strive to be aware of the way my company seeks to win business and try to remain firmly within the realm of ethical clarity. 

Big Data Is Our Civil Rights Issue

* The concept of collecting data first, while asking questions second is very concerning. In my previous career I was responsible for ensuring that my company abided by GDPR standards with regards to data collection as we worked closely with Microsoft. We were required to operate on a principle of least required data, meaning we were required to define a "schema" for the data we collected prior to collection. The danger of Big Data's more recent practice of mass data collection without a schema can lead to some very scary conclusions without proper regulation. This quote says it all - "We're not disciminating if we tailor things to you based on what we know about you, right?". This once again comes back to the dangerous responsibility that our society has when it comes to the reach of capitalism. Everything is commodified and companies will go to great lengths to find the most effective way to advertise and target their products to the right customers. If left unchecked, this is a manipulative and opportunistic approach that will lead to civil rights violations and yet another example of the prioritization of products over people.
